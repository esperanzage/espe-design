            UX Design for Financial Planning App
          </h1>
          <p>
            In order to expand the reach and better one of their live events, the team behind an brand came for a technology partner. The event consists of a course that aims to improve people’s control over their financial lives. The product, a <span class="highlight">web application</span>, works as a tool to help users understand their financial situation, and help them in the planning and
            tracking of their financial goals.
            <p>I was involved as a <span class="highlight">UX/UI Designer</span> for this project, working from the Discovery phase onwards, until the implementation of the product.</p>

  <div class="case-section"><div><h2>The challenge</h2><p>The application had not been updated in some time, resulting in an outdated product that wasn’t truly supporting its users in the course as expected, and it didn’t follow the current branding. A specific problem was that around 70% of users weren’t completing the input of their basic financial information, which is fundamental to understanding their current economic situation, the event content and fulfilling the goals of the event.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
    <div class="case-section"> <div><h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3><p>In order to find general usability problems in the current solution we did a Heuristic Evaluation of the current tool.
    This helped us identify from a general point of view, where we identified usability problems and allowed us to take
    action in order to improve them.</p></div></div>
    <div class="case-section"> <div><h3>Demographic Survey</h3><p>A demographic survey helped us identify who our users were and was a great way to connect with them and start building a profile for our personas.</p></div></div>
    <div class="case-section"> <div><h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3><p> From the survey we were able to contact users for interviews, these really helped in understanding pain points and what users needed.</p></div></div>
 <div class="case-section"> <div><h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>Based on our Interviews and Demographic Survey we developed a Persona at this stage in order to help us bring our
      knowledge of users and the problems they were facing to the whole team, also as a clear view of what we had to keep in
      mind when working on this project.</p></div><img class="section-image" src="./imgs/financial-persona.png"></div>
    <div class="case-section"> <div><h3>User Journey</h3> <p>Building a User Journey was a great way to align, understand and communicate both with stakeholders and the team. It
    allowed us to see the big picture and how it all came together, how our users were feeling and which were the exact
    stages of the experience we needed to improve.</p></div></div>
