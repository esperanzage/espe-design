            UX Design for Financial Planning App
          </h1>
          <p>
            In order to expand the reach and better one of their live events, the team behind an brand came for a technology partner. The event consists of a course that aims to improve people’s control over their financial lives. The product, a <span class="highlight">web application</span>, works as a tool to help users understand their financial situation, and help them in the planning and
            tracking of their financial goals.
            <p>I was involved as a <span class="highlight">UX/UI Designer</span> for this project, working from the Discovery phase onwards, until the implementation of the product.</p>

  <div class="case-section"><div><h2>The challenge</h2><p>The application had not been updated in some time, resulting in an outdated product that wasn’t truly supporting its users in the course as expected, and it didn’t follow the current branding. A specific problem was that around 70% of users weren’t completing the input of their basic financial information, which is fundamental to understanding their current economic situation, the event content and fulfilling the goals of the event.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="case-section"><div><h2>Result</h2><p>An updated application that followed brand guidelines, and met business and users' goals by increasing the percentage of users inputing their financial information before the event, which was one of the main goals, by improving the experience and explaining concepts, more people were able to complete their information without assistance. The application is used after the event for users to keep track of their financial goals, being able to modify and experiment with their information, which helps them make better financial decisions.</p>
