    <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      In order to find general usability problems in the current solution we did
      a Heuristic Evaluation of the current tool. This helped us identify from a
      general point of view, where we identified usability problems and allowed
      us to take action in order to improve them.

      way to connect with them and start building a profile for our personas.

    <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>
      Based on our Interviews and Demographic Survey we developed a Persona at
      this stage in order to help us bring our knowledge of users and the
      problems they were facing to the whole team, also as a clear view of what
      we had to keep in mind when working on this project.

    <h3>User Journey</h3>
    <p>
      Building a User Journey was a great way to align, understand and
      communicate both with stakeholders and the team. It allowed us to see the
      big picture and how it all came together, how our users were feeling and
      which were the exact stages of the experience we needed to improve.
