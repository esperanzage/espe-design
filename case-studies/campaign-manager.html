        <p>The client was using multiple tools and manual processes in order to generate a PDF report to present to their customers
        of what the impact of their campaigns had been. This took a lot of work and time to create, since most of the time they
        had to search the campaign posts and monitor them manually. The challenge was to bring this report to be generated
        automatically, leveraging machine learning to give key insights to improve and measure campaign impact.</p>
